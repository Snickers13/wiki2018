### **What is an IAT?** ###

The implicit association test (IAT) is a psychological tool for determining implicit (subconscious) biases towards or against opposing categories (Gray and Bjorklund, 2014). It runs on the theory that the more closely two things are already neuropathologically linked in someone’s mind, the faster they are going to respond when those two things share a response key on the keyboard (Gray and Bjorklund, 2014). For example, often people will respond more quickly when words concerning insects share a response key with negative words, pointing towards a possible bias against insects.

### **What are we doing with it?** ###

Waterloo’s iGEM is hoping to utilize this tool in an effort to better understand the public’s biases and reactions towards the field of synthetic biology. We would like to see what words, if any, people have an implicit bias against or towards. Once we know the words will most likely elicit a negative reaction, we can work on finding and using alternate words to better introduce the public to synthetic biology ideas and projects.

### **How does it work?** ###

The task itself is fairly simple; five “blocks” or sets of 30 words that the participants have to sort into their categories using the “E” or “I” keys on the keyboard. In our study, participants will be asked to sort synthetic biology words such as yeast and amyloid, while sorting traditional technology words such as computer and tablet into their own category. They will also be asked to sort negative and positive words, such as anger or laughter. The most interesting portions of the task are when two categories share a response key. For instance, when negative and synthetic biology share a key, and traditional technology and positive share a key, faster responses in this block could indicate an implicit bias against synthetic biology. With the data generated, we can tell which synthetic biology words people were slowest and fastest to associate with negative, and in another block, faster or slower to associate with positive.

### **How did we set it up?** ###

We set up the IAT using code graciously offered by PsyToolKit, an online bank of psychological tests and tools. The next step was submitting it to the University of Waterloo’s Office of Research Ethics. We wanted to ensure that we followed governing rules for research with human participants. As well, we wanted to make sure study participants were protected and that our research was conducted in a way that serves the needs of participants and society. In order to achieve this we made sure we made an official research review application to our university’s research ethics board. Once our survey and task got Ethics Approval, we shared the links to our task and consent surveys to our Facebook page. We will run the task until the end of term.


### **Methods** ###

15 voluntary participants were recruited from Waterloo iGEM’s Facebook page to participate in this study. We assumed that Waterloo iGEM’s diverse range of followers is a reasonable representation of the public. Participants were given an online consent form to read and agree to before participating in the study.

After consenting to the study, participants were given instructions to download the IAT study and complete it. Participants sorted words into categories as they appeared on the screen using the “E” and “I" keys on the keyboard. The first round was a practice and control round so participants could learn which words are in the biotechnology category and which are in the traditional technology category. Whether the participants had the biotechnology category on the “E” or the “I” key for the first block was random, so as to minimize introducing bias into the experiment.

After pressing a key (“E” for the category on the left, “I” for the category on the right) to sort a word, a smiley face would appear if the word was sorted correctly; a frowny face would appear if the word was sorted incorrectly or not sorted at all within 3000 milliseconds. The second block was entirely the same, with the exception that there was instead be a pleasant word category and an unpleasant word category. The third block was a combination of the first two (two categories will share the same key). The fourth block was the same as the first, with the categories switched to the other key they were not previously on. The fifth block was similar to the third.

After the task was completed participants were directed to a short survey to answer some questions, give the researchers any feedback, and entered for a chance to win a Starbucks gift card.

All claims are tested with alpha = 0.05, with Microsoft Excel 2016 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24.



### **Hypotheses Tests** ###

Ho: μ control blocks = μ mix compatible block
H1: μ control blocks ≠ μ mix compatible block  
Where μ = the population (members of the public) mean response time (ms).

Ho: μ control blocks = μ mix incompatible block
H1: μ control blocks ≠ μ mix incompatible block  
Where μ = the population (members of the public) mean response time (ms).


### **Results** ###

There is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05, the mean response time differs significantly differs at alpha = 0.05 between the control blocks and the mix compatible block (paired-samples t-test; p >0.05, d.f = 14). Even though there was a violation of the normality assumption, the departure from normality is of little concern.

There is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05, the mean response time differs significantly at alpha = 0.05 between the control blocks and the mix incompatible block (paired-samples t-test; p < 0.03, d.f = 14). Even though there was a violation of the normality assumption, the departure from normality is of little concern.



Boxplots comparing the distribution of mean response time (ms) each presented word of participants (n = 15) for the the mixed compatible and mixed incompatible blocks. Sampled in 2017.


### **Discussion** ###


We noticed some very interesting trends.  Overall, we saw that the mean response times for the mix incompatible block have been significantly slower than the mean response times in the control blocks two and four. Surprisingly, this indicates that participants were generally slower at responding when the “biotechnology” and “unpleasant” categories shared a key (p < 0.03). This could mean that the average participant may have had a slight bias towards synthetic biology. Conversely,  participants showed no statistical difference, indicating no bias (positive or negative), between the mix compatible block and the control blocks. Their mean response times were not statistically different when “biotechnology” and “pleasant” shared a key.

When we looked at specific words from our project, we also got some interesting results. The word “aggregate” was slightly faster in the mix incompatible than in the mix compatible, suggesting a possible bias against the word aggregate (i.e. associated faster with “unpleasant” than with “pleasant”). However, the difference in the response times could also suggest that there is some confusion around the word itself. It is possible participants do not have a preconceived bias towards or against the word aggregate, thus allowing for some inconsistencies. We should be very careful to clearly explain this term in all future communication. As well, the word yeast was slightly slower in the mix compatible block. This could suggest a slight bias against yeast, but it could also suggest some confusion around yeast’s involvement in synthetic biology. Yeast is commonly associated with things such as beer and bread, and we think there is a possibility that participants were discovering yeast is used in synthetic biology. We should continue to educate people about the use of yeast as a model organism in synthetic biology and lessen potential confusion.

Interestingly, the word “prion”, one of the most integral terms related to our project, was actually *faster* in the mix compatible block, and was associated more quickly with pleasant words. This is exciting, because it suggests we have been doing a good job with engaging and educating the public about our project. Other words related to our project, including amyloid, FRET, and enzymes, had no statistical difference in response times between the mix compatible and mix incompatible blocks. This suggests no bias towards or against these words, and it provides a good place to continue our communication about the benefits of our project, as we may be able to elicit a positive initial feeling towards these terms and our project.

Of course, we noticed some trends with words associated with the field of synthetic biology as a whole, as opposed to our project specific terms. The word bacteria was sorted particularly slowly in both mix blocks, and was even slow enough to be an outlier in the mix compatible block. This suggests that participants have an implicit bias against bacteria, as they associate bacteria with pleasant words very slowly. Bacteria are such an important tool in synthetic biology, and, although bacteria can be harmful, we and others in the field of synthetic biology must really stress the benefits and safety of this system to elicit more positive associations with this term.

BioBricks was sorted slightly faster in the mix compatible, and we think this could be due to the fact that it had “bio” in its name, and this was easier to sort with the category that shared part of its name.

Overall, we’ve learned a fair amount of information already, but there is lots more to be done. We can use different words, and we can make improvements on the structure of the test. Soon enough, we’ll know for sure which words we should use to better relate our project and synthetic biology to the general public!


### **Next Steps** ###

A next step for this project would include extending the sample size to make it as representative as possible. This year, a large proportion of the participants were students associated with the University of Waterloo. In the future, we would like to expand this to not only other universities and colleges nationally and internationally, but also to workplaces and schools outside of the university spheres. With more diverse participants, we can better recognize the general public’s reactions to synthetic biology, as well as how different places may perceive the field. The more we know about people’s thoughts and biases towards synthetic biology, the better equipped we’ll be when relating to the public and introducing new scientific concepts.

As well, we’ve found some of the words used in the control categories “pleasant” and “unpleasant” may not be the same for everybody. Words such as family, accident, or friends could sometimes be sorted much slower than average in the pleasant versus unpleasant block, and this could be because these words are not universally positively or negatively associated for everybody. Any of these words need to be identified to avoid making the test more difficult for participants as well as preventing a less robust control baseline if they do not associate a categorically pleasant word with positive bias. As well, some words and acronyms are not well known. For instance, HVAC was sorted incorrectly more than any other word, suggesting that most participants did not know that HVAC stands for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. Words or acronyms like this should be avoided to ensure the test is as rigorous as possible.

We would also like to extend the project and our results such that other iGEM teams can use it. Once we collect more data we intend to create a thesaurus of synthetic biology terms. This way, iGEM teams could use the more “public friendly” version of the concepts used in their projects, which could foster a more positive response to their projects and the field of synthetic biology.

Overall, there is still a lot of work to be done, but this could be a great tool for educating and introducing the public to synthetic biology. As support grows, so does research, and there are many breakthroughs on that horizon.
