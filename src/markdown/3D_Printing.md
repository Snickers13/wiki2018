At some point, every lab faces limitations when it comes to resources for experiments. For some, this limit is much lower than others, to the extent where even basic experiments become difficult to complete. To address this problem, iGEM Waterloo has begun creating a catalogue of 3D-printable lab equipment for teams to download and print for their own use.

## Assessing the Need

From communicating with teams at last yearâ€™s Jamboree, we became cognizant about financial barriers many teams faced over the year. In some cases, these barriers significantly limited the experiments teams are able to perform.  

We hypothesized that there are teams in the iGEM community who would benefit from an inexpensive, yet performance grade alternative to obtain simple lab equipment. To confirm this, we sent out surveys to all iGEM teams asking about their opinions on 3D printing lab equipment, past uses and accessibility to 3D Printers, how much they spent on resources, and the importance of having sufficient lab equipment.

Based on survey responses, the general consensus was that the expense of lab equipment could be reduced by using 3D printed lab equipment as long as it could meet specific performance criteria. This provided validity to our hypothesis, and we continued with the development of this project.

## 3D Printing

To start, we needed ideas on what we could 3D print. Ideally what we made would have to be useful and have a geometry that is feasible to make using 3D printers of different qualities. We consulted our lab team about what sorts of equipment they were lacking in the lab or what types of contraptions would help with their experiments. In addition, we asked the iGEM teams we surveyed for examples of equipment we could print as well. Throughout the design process, our lab team tested out the prototypes and provided feedback, which helped us improve designs and increase effectiveness and quality of the printed equipment.

The main limitation with using 3D printing plastics, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyactic acid (PLA), include sterility, porousness, and strength. The plastics must be able to withstand the heat from an autoclave in order to be sterilized, they cannot be used to hold liquids, and they must be able to withstand certain amounts of force. With these guidelines, we wanted to start by creating equipment that would not be subject to these risks. Before attempting to design and print everything on our list, we started off by designing a gel comb. Using PLA plastic, we created our first piece of lab equipment for trial. After successful results, we continued to pursue other designs such as different sized gel combs, test tube racks, and microcentrifuge tube holders.

One of our team members with 3D modelling experience ran a quick workshop on how to use CAD software for other team members to attend. As the Student version of AutoCAD was free to download, it fits really well with our goal of accessibility.  Learning how to use AutoCAD under the tutelage of a peer was a fun activity and helped the team grow together, while also learning a new skill. While working in a spatial simulated environment poses its challenges, it becomes relatively easy to use after some practice. Even without an in-house expert, there are many free tutorials available online.

After a couple hours of work together, the ability to perform basic operations and the knowledge of some useful tricks were gained. Further hours of individual practice allowed for the creation of quality schematics. This knowledge was used by the team members to produce gel combs of varying sizes and dimensions, as well as experimental test tube rack designs, and assist with other designs used in the collection.

To determine quality, we ran performance testing on the plastics. We tested the gel combs under the criteria of: well quality, well consistency, and comb deterioration. In comparison to commercial grade gel combs, our 3D printed versions performed equally as well, and have been used over a dozen times without and signs of wear and tear. In terms of strength, PLA plastic has a tensile strength of ~65 MPa and ABS has a tensile strength of ~38 MPa. **Both values are subject to printer settings such as infill, shell thickness, layer height, and print speed.** It was determined that the type of plastic we were using could not withstand the heat from an autoclave or from a bunsen burner.
