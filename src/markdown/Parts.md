This year, our team biobricked the MetE gene into a cassette with LacI promoter:
[BBa_K2573000](http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2573000). This can be cloned into a methionine auxotroph to restore its ability to produce methionine. The MetE coding sequence can also be PCR amplified out of this biobrick and assembled into a new one for a variety of applications. For instance, it can be put under the control of an optogenetic promoter/system (like CcaS/R or pDawn).
