## Snake35

### What is Snake35?

This year, iGEM Waterloo has chosen a foundational advance project. These types of projects focus on the technology and processes involved in synthetic biology, which are not very well-known to the general public. In contrast to other types of projects, foundational advance projects do not usually focus on a single application, such as curing a disease. Furthermore, they tend to have less popular buzzwords for the general public. As such, it can be difficult to explain the idea and purpose of our foundational advance project to the general public.  
After consulting iGEM Imperial 2016’s [_Visualization: A Guide for Synthetic Biologists_](http://2016.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College/Integrated_Practices), we decided a great way to convey the information from our project would be to create a visual, interactive game! We’ve called it Snake35.

### Instructions

What makes Snake35 different than classic Snake? Well for starters, your objective is no longer just to make the biggest, baddest snake of all time. Our point-based version requires you to match a CFP block next to a YFP block in order to excite it. For every YFP in the excited, fluorescing state, you receive a point. However, if you have a YFP that isn’t beside CFP, it stays dark (deactivated) and you don’t receive a point. Get the highest score and give yourself a pat on the back!  
In our game, you must assemble a blue block next to a dim yellow block in order to score points. The result of successfully doing so causes the yellow block to fluoresce which is analogous to our FRET experiment. This game demonstrates how you must organize the proteins in a specific arrangement to observe fluorescence of YFP. However, if you have a Sup35 in between a YFP and a CFP, the YFP will not fluoresce as the arrangement is not correct.

### Testing Snake35

During the Waterloo Faculty of Science Open House, our booth had a table where we displayed and presented Snake35. Kids got the chance to play the game and learn about the foundational concepts of FRET. Our game received lots of positive feedback from kids and parents alike which proves that our demonstration tool was very effective in conveying the information we wanted!
