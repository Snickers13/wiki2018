## Applications of Prion Project

The Waterloo iGEM 2017 project is a proof of concept for a system that has an application in increasing the speed of enzymatic reactions in bulk industrial reactors. This highlighted application is in the spotlight as the most practical, useful and feasible application possible based on this project.

In enzymatic pathways, the product of one enzyme must be passed onto the next enzyme in the pathway. In cells, related enzymes are often close to each other and so this is not a concern. However, if performing such a reaction in vitro the proteins would on average be much further apart due to their paths following random walks. This slows the speed of the reaction.

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that decreasing the distance between enzymes is sufficient to increase their interaction and decrease the time taken for intermediates to move between them. Knowing this, a system that brings enzymes close together should be able to speed up a reaction in vitro.

By attaching Sup35’s prion domain to different associated proteins and then inducing aggregation, this goal can be accomplished. It has been established that it is possible to attach prion domains to proteins while retaining the functions of those proteins in aggregates, so the addition of the tag should not be a problem. Additionally, production of these tagged proteins can be performed E. coli, and the subsequent extraction of the proteins and induction of aggregation should be relatively simple.

There are a few existing techniques that one could use to bring proteins close together for this purpose, but this method has several advantages over them.

One group has proposed bringing enzymes together by anchoring them to the surface of a fat micelle. However, such a micelle could not be gathered from a solution easily and reused; the Sup35 domain aggregates can be centrifuged out of solution, which is a simple process that should allow them to be reused.

Another potential solution is using an engineered scaffold protein to latch onto the different enzymes in a system. One downside of this solution are that it requires that one make the enzymes in the system compatible with the scaffold by tagging them. While this is required in our solution as well, the tags are all the same and so the process of adding them is less complex. Additionally, one does not need to make a separate protein to serve as a scaffold. Another downside is, as with the last solution, that reusing the enzymes on a scaffold protein may be difficult. A third downside is that one is limited in how many enzymes can be added to the scaffold. With the Sup35 tag based system, any number of proteins can be tagged and added to the aggregate.

In summary, our solution is feasible, and due to its versatility and the reusability is better than existing solutions. One specific example of a way this system could be used would be in conjunction with Guelph iGEM’s 2017 project; the project is based on a pair of enzymes that can be used to remove calcium oxalate from brewing containers. Because the enzymes work together, bringing them onto the same aggregate may help them work together and speed up the removal process.

There are more secondary applications that have been brainstormed based on consultations and interviews from experts we have contacted as well as other research papers read thoroughly. These have been formated showing each application’s general concept, how the application is used, the benefits and restrictions respectively.

### Vaccine Preparation

#### General Concept
This foundational advance also has the opportunity to be introduced in vaccine preparation. Using prion aggregates or prion-like aggregated proteins, we could make a more effective vaccine to dissolve at a slower rate once introduced into the body. This works much to the same therapeutic effect as the lipid molecule squalane or other liposome encapsulated nanoparticles (Fox, 2009). The aggregated proteins are developed and used in vitro via biotechnology scale up methodologies.

#### Application
This can allow for a slow release of the vaccine being degraded at a slower and steady rate. Due to the variability of disease causing agents used in different vaccines, different prion-like proteins could be designed to adapt to each individual vaccine for optimal sustained degradation.

#### Benefits
Such a therapeutic could then be licensed off to larger biopharmaceutical firms with enough capital to sustain and develop a large enough commercial market to make a global difference in the innovative studies of vaccine preparation. But why is this therapeutic important? Sustained degradation of vaccines furthermore leads to fewer vaccine administration dosages. This means less cost for pharmaceutical firms to develop, and also gives a lower cost to the patient as well consuming fewer dosages.

#### Restrictions
Vaccine preparation and administration is already quite established within the biopharmaceutical market with minimal doses already given for many vaccines. Such innovation will be only given in niche vaccine drug deliveries based on the the restrictive properties of each pathogen coated with its respective prion-like proteins.

### Increased Efficiency of Antimicrobial Peptides

#### General Concept
With the recent rise of antibiotic superbugs, alternative approaches to eliminate harmful bacteria are necessary. In 2015, researchers from Leuven, Belgium conducted a study to investigate the use of protein aggregates as a measure to kill bacteria. They proposed that the introduction of engineered antimicrobial peptides coding aggregate-prone sequences would induce bactericidal. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are known peptides that disrupt bacterial cell membrane and induce cell lysis. The aggregation of AMP is expected to not only amplify its efficiency but also corrupt proteolysis in bacteria, completely rendering their vital processes. Additionally, AMP has a multi-target mode of action, which makes it difficult for bacteria to develop resistance against them. More importantly, AMP only binds to bacterial transporter protein not found in mammalian cells, which makes them harmless to animals.

#### Application and Benefit
With Waterloo 2017 iGEM team’s project, the fusion of prion domain with AMP can be achieved to effectively increase its aggregation in vivo. As a result, the efficiency of AMP activity will be magnified, which would improve its function as a bactericidal agent.  

#### Restrictions
The mechanism of AMP remains a relative mystery to us, which would hinder our progress in designing this method. Additionally, S. aureus is seemingly resistance against AMP due to possession negatively charged lipid in its membrane.

### Nanosensors Application

#### General Concept
We could take our prion aggregate and use it as a nanoparticle. By equipping the aggregate with antibodies for a specific protein, we can use it to identify the presence of the target protein to various concentrations as well (a separate test done afterwards).

#### Application
The whole concept of nanosensors is fascinating itself because it reduces the amount of time needed to identify the presence of bacteria such as E. Coli. This is also perfect for using in labs to enhance identification speed.


#### Benefits
The price of around 20 nm nanogold is approximately $500 per 1mL of solution. Our application would be more cost effective than synthesizing gold nanoparticles. We could hence make large structures of proteins.

#### Restrictions
Storing conditions may affect the feasibility of using it in the field.

### Increased Efficiency of Production and Purification of Peptides

#### General Concept
Our project considers the use of prion domains to increase the function of another protein via fusion due to the aggregating abilities of the prion domain. Research done by a team at Tsinghua University in Beijing used ELK16, which forms “highly active enzyme aggregates”, and inteins, also known as protein introns, to reduce the cost and time associated with the production and purification of medium to large sized peptides [1].
The C terminus of the protein you want to purify is fused to the N terminus of the intein, and the C terminus of the intein is fused to the N terminus of ELK16[1]. The ELK16 regions form insoluble aggregates, which are easily isolated via centrifugation. A reagent induces cleavage at the N-termini of the intein, causing the isolated insoluble unit to shed the target protein, which are then isolated via reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography.

#### Benefits
The potential use of prion domains instead of ELK16 could further reduce the costs associated with this process by allowing for the reuse of the intein-aggregation domain.

#### Application
This could be achieved by inducing the prion domains into their normal state, and using expressed protein ligation to attach new target proteins to the N-termini of the inteins.

#### Restrictions**
The question that must be asked is whether the reduction of costs gained in the reuse of the intein-aggregation domain will offset the increase in cost associated with protein ligation. It essentially boils down to what would be more expensive, the act of producing new fusion proteins, or the act of de-aggregating and reusing your existing fusion proteins.

### Targeted Apoptosis Application

#### General Concept
The misfolding of proteins leads to the formation of prions, aggregates of misfolded proteins that crowd within a cell, up to the point where the cell undergoes apoptosis (cell death) due to overcrowding. While prions do cause diseases in humans and other animals, and are rightly considered dangerous, there are some circumstances for which overcrowding is a desired feature of a treatment system.

The general idea is to take advantage of the “natural apoptotic process of prokaryotes” which was coined as “proapoptosis” by researcher Alaya Hochman in 1997. In summary, the paper claims that the execution of proapoptosis requires the activation of a developmental program that results in massive structural and morphological changes. These changes may include cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and proteolysis and DNA degradation, followed by cell fragmentation into apoptotic bodies that are phagocytized, just like eukaryotes in the standard apoptotic process. Bacteria currently exhibit a range of natural developmental programs for survival purposes. For example, *Caulobacter cereus* forms swarmer cells and differentiation in order to adapt to its stressful environment. If we are interested in activating a developmental program instead of using a targeted payload system as described above, we would need to formulate a system that is possible to be activated by the bacterium itself, and this would possibly involve similar chemical pathways. It would be of interest at this point to investigate the possible chemical pathways that our prion-like proteins can take, and this would be a good first step in the design process.

#### Application and Benefits
There was a study done by Eric Kandel and Kausik Si which determined that cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB), an RNA binding protein, had a role to play in memory storage. CPEB has two conformations, the native one and the non-native (prion-like) conformation. This non-native conformation is capable of acting like a prion, such that it changes conformation to become multimeric and self-perpetuates this by inducing other CPEB to change conformation, as shown in yeast and the sea slug Aplysia. It was shown, in Aplysia, that this prion-like form was what marked active synapses to store long-term memories. A similarly functioning protein, Orb2, was found in drosophila, so it is possible this may have a human homologue. Knowing this, we may be able to use our own knowledge of prions to help treat diseases concerning long-term memory loss, such as Alzheimer’s or amnesia.

#### Restrictions
As previously mentioned, this system requires activation by the strain of bacteria that is being targeted. If there is no natural pathway for the strain to activate the system on its own, a supplementary system would have to be created to support this action. Another restriction with this system is finding compatible chemical pathways between our prions and the strain of interest. If there is little compatibility, even with the prion with the best match, we would be forced to catalyze the process with an additional set of reactions.

### Ethanol Fermentation Pathway using Aggregation

#### General Concept
One application of our project is that it could help speed up fermentation processes in the production of ethanol. To create ethanol, we start off with complex sugars and yeast; the yeast then breaks the complex sugars down into glucose, and eventually into ethanol and carbon dioxide (Lin et. al, 2005).

 ![fermentation pathway]({{image "fermentation2.png" "directlink" mode}})

With the help of our project, we could use aggregation to speed up the fermentation pathway. To do this, however, we use monomeric enzymes, as it has not yet been proven that we can form homodimers in the prion state. Most of the enzymes in the fermentation pathway for glucose are not monomeric. Instead of using glucose as a starting sugar, we can use mannose. The first two enzymes in mannose’s fermentation pathway are monomeric. We could therefore test whether we can apply our project idea to mannose’s fermentation pathway to help speed up its process.

#### Benefits
If we can find a way to speed up the fermentation process to create ethanol, it will have an enormous impact on the alcohol industry. Beer and wine, for example, will be created at a much faster pace; this will have a dramatic impact on many stakeholders, such as beer and wine producers, alcoholic beverage vendors, and consumers of alcohol.
#### Application

This would be used to speed up the production of ethanol, and in turn, of alcoholic beverages.

#### Restrictions
Mannose’s fermentation process is already slower than glucose’s; will our project speed it up to be even faster than glucose’s on its own. For example, glucose can be 70-80% fermented in 20-30 days, while mannose is only 30-50% percent fermented in the same amount of time (Peterson et. al, 1920).
