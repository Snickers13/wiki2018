An important property to understand in the implementation of our project is the upper bound for the efficiency of a given system.

There are two parts to this problem. First, we look at how aggregates are likely to form in time. Second, we examine how the ordering of proteins within an aggregate affects the overall efficiency of the system, and determine the expected value of this efficiency assuming the proteins join the aggregate at random.

Calculating these values allowed us to prioritize which experiments to devote lab resources to and gave us a better understanding of the systems we were studying. Additionally, similar techniques may be applied to judge the efficiency of new applications of our project.
