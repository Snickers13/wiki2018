Our project would not have been possible without the help of several people. Here, we would like to take the time to recognise and thank everyone who helped us on our journey this year! 

## Project Development

The 2018 iGEM project E. Co-light was a team effort and would not be possible without hours of research done to make this project a reality, from those who were involved in the project development phase, to those who contributed as the year progressed. 

Special thanks to Jyler Menard for finding many of the papers regarding MetE as a control mechanism for cell growth.

The original idea for optogenetically controlled co-cultures was developed by Cody Receno as part of the BIOL 349 (Synthetic Biology Project Design) course, co-taught by Trevor Charles and Brian Ingalls.


## Interlab 
We would like to extend our most sincere gratitude to Prof. Raymond Legge (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo) and Andrew Assatory, a graduate student working under Prof. Legge. These results would not have been possible without their assistance. Prof. Legge kindly allowed us to use his BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader on very short notice, and Andrew accommodated our use of the plate reader into his busy schedule.
