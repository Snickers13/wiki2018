Throughout the year, we've been working hard on developing, testing, and re-designing our system. Here, we demonstrate that our system works!

## Our method of control is viable
First of all, we have demonstrated that our method of controling growht (MetE) is viable. While other research groups had previously shown that _E. coli_ growth can be controlled by regulating methionine synthesis via the MetE gene, we've proven that this sytem also works for our new application (co-cultures). In a co-culture, it is important to consider not only how to control one population of bacteria, but also to think about how the other bacterial population might affect it/the sytem as a whole. This was one of the first things we set out to do by answering the question "Is methionine shared between cells". See our [design page](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Waterloo/Design) for more detail about the rational behind this experiment. See our [results page](http://2018.igem.org/Team:Waterloo/Results) for detailed results showing that methionine produced by one population of _E. coli_ cells is neither secreted into the environment nor shared with other _E. coli_ populations that aren't able to produce their own.
