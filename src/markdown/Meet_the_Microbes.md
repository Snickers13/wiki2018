### Strain 
_Escherichia coli_ [JT2 SKA974](https://www.addgene.org/80403/) 
This strain has been engineered for optogenetic control using CcaS/R. Its genomic MetE gene is under control of the CcaS/R promoter. It also has a Kanamycin resistance gene in its genome. 

### Plasmids

### Antibiotic Resistance(s)
Kanamycin

### Growth Rate 

### Fluorescent Marker 
None

### Can produce methionine? 
None 

### Which experiments was I involved in? 
- Is methionine shared between cells

### Strain 
_Escherichia coli_ [JT2 SKA974](https://www.addgene.org/80403/) 
This strain has been engineered for optogenetic control using CcaS/R. Its genomic MetE gene is under control of the CcaS/R promoter. It also has a Kanamycin resistance gene in its genome. 
### Plasmids
[pSR43.6r](https://www.addgene.org/63197/) (CcaS and its photoreceptor)
[pSR58.6](https://www.addgene.org/63176/) (CcaR and sfGFP under the CcaR promoter)
 - Note that we made 2 versions of this strain. One contains both these plasmids, unaltered, and was used for characterization experiments. We cut GFP out of pSR58.6 for the second version of this strain, and used it for non-characterization experiments.   

### Antibiotic Resistance(s)
Kanamycin
Spectinomycin
Chloramphenicol 

### Growth Rate 

### Fluorescent Marker 
GFP in the characterization version of this strain, only expressed when CcaS/R is activated

### Can produce methionine? 
Yes, but only when CcaS/R is activated. 

### Which experiments was I involved in? 
- Is methionine shared between cells
