- 

#### Fluorescent Marker 
- None

#### Can produce methionine? 
- No 

#### Which experiments was I involved in? 
- Is methionine shared between cells?

## JT2 - CcaS/R

![JT2 CcaS/R](http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/a/a9/T--Waterloo--MeetMicro_JT2CcaSR.png) 
#### Strain 
- _Escherichia coli_ [JT2 SKA974](https://www.addgene.org/80403/) 
This strain has been engineered for optogenetic control using CcaS/R. Its genomic MetE gene is under control of the CcaS/R promoter. It also has a Kanamycin resistance gene in its genome. 

#### Plasmids
- [pSR43.6r](https://www.addgene.org/63197/) (CcaS, its photoreceptor, p15A origin of replication)
- [pSR58.6](https://www.addgene.org/63176/) (CcaR, sfGFP under the CcaR promoter, ColeI origin of replication)
  - Note that we made 2 versions of this strain. One contains both these plasmids, unaltered, and was used for characterization experiments. We cut GFP out of pSR58.6 for the second version of this strain, and used it for non-characterization experiments.   

#### Antibiotic Resistance(s)
- Kanamycin
- Spectinomycin
- Chloramphenicol 

#### Growth Rate 
- 

#### Fluorescent Marker 
- GFP in the characterization version of this strain, only expressed when CcaS/R is activated.

#### Can produce methionine? 
- Yes, but only when CcaS/R is activated. 

#### Which experiments was I involved in? 
- Is methionine shared between cells? 
- What is the metabolic load of (over)expressing MetE?
- Can we control growth with red and green light?

#### Strain 
- _Escherichia coli_ DH5alpha 

#### Plasmids
- None

#### Antibiotic Resistance(s)
- None

#### Growth Rate 
- 

#### Fluorescent Marker 
- None

#### Can produce methionine? 
- Yes, with my wild type genomic MetE gene. 

### Which experiments was I involved in? 
- Can we reliably measure 2 populations in co-culture?

## DH5alpha - GFP

![DH5 GFP]()

### Fluorescent Marker 
- GFP, constitutively expressed. 

### Can produce methionine? 
- Yes, with my wild type genomic MetE gene. 

### Which experiments was I involved in?
