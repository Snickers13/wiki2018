### **Project Determination** ###

At the beginning our team season, every member gets to present possible project ideas. Follow this initial meeting, we spend the next couple of weeks flushing out the ideas in groups in more detail, looking into primary literature, designing possible experiments, and sourcing required materials. We then present these ideas again before selecting the project. To select our team project this year, we wanted to conduct  quantitative and qualitative analysis, so that we could come to a consensus in an efficient and fair manner.

To achieve this, we created a template for project selection that we used to evaluate all of our potential projects. The assessments were based on the criteria described in the iGEM judging guide, project assessment documentation from previous iGEM teams’ wikis, and anything else we felt is was import to evaluate.

Each team member was asked to score different qualities of the project (novelty, feasibility, interest, applications, and usefulness) and back up their quantitative evaluation with written comments. With the diverse disciplines amongst our team, we received input from a science, mathematics, engineering and business perspective. This analysis was then presented to our advisors to ensure that we had not overlooked any relevant aspect in our consideration.

Below we have included our general guide template with the justification for our choices in criteria, as well as our team’s evaluation of all the projects we pitched. This evaluation resulting in our team’s selection of this year’s project, the functional prion project now called: Prions be Lit - Functional Amyloid as a Biological Tool.




### **Project Selection Guide** ###



### **Primary Criteria: evaluates the viability of a project** ###
#### **Novelty** ####
If the proposed project was likely to fall under the Foundational Advance track, we added an additional primary criteria. The basis of this track is to develop novel solutions to technical problems, thus the novelty of the project was one of the priorities.
#### **Feasibility** ####
When developing project ideas, teams must also consider the amount of resources available to them. It is important to be able to achieve their goals with the resources, time, and technical abilities they have to ensure the project is completed and finished on time.

### **Secondary Criteria: evaluates benefits of selecting a particular idea as an iGEM project.** ###
#### **Interest** ####
The level of interest amongst the members in a project is valuable as a teams with a greater interest in their project are like more likely to excel and be successful.
#### **Applicability of the team** ####
It is important to select a project that will enable all subteams to contribute to the  project and fulfill medal criteria.
#### **Usefulness** ####
How useful the project is and how it may impact society (the degree of stakeholder benefit and how many stakeholders would gain this benefit).

Following the team analysis, the project proposals were presented to advisors from the University of Waterloo’s Faculties of Biology and Math. Advisors from the University of Waterloo Faculty of Biology: Brian Ingalls, Trevor Charles, Barbara Moffatt, Andrew Doxey, and Forbes Burkowski. Their feedback and expertise was acknowledged and factored into our project decision as well.

### **Conclusion:** ###

In conclusion, the Waterloo iGEM 2017 team has decided to select the engineered prion project for this year.



Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local, national and/or international communities or other approaches. write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, and document any special activities you did (such as visiting experts, talking to lawmakers, or doing public engagement)


In order to evaluate the project choice that Waterloo iGEM seeks to choose for the consensus of its team, proper quantitative and qualitative analysis must be done. We collected our team’s opinion and ranking of each project quantitatively, followed by consulting with our advisors to get qualitative consulting advice.

### **Project Determination** ###

The selection process for this years project began with several of our members creating project proposals and presenting their ideas to the whole team. Each project idea went through several layers of analysis, starting with over 30 individual assessments by members from all subteams. With the diverse disciplines amongst our team, we received input from a science, mathematics, engineering and business perspective. The individual assessments were compiled, resulting in a quantitative analysis of which project the team believed was the best to pursue. The assessments were based on the set of criteria that we have carefully articulated, which is described below:

### **Primary Criteria: evaluates the most important aspects of a project** ###
#### **Novelty** ####
This year, each of the project proposals fell under the Foundational Advance track. The basis of this track is to develop novel solutions to technical problems, thus the novelty of the project was one of the priorities.
#### **Feasibility** ####
When developing project ideas, teams must also consider the amount of resources available to them. It is important to be able to achieve their goals with what they have to produce a complete project

### **Secondary Criteria: evaluates the level of engagement for subteams in the organisation.** ###
#### **Interest** ####
The level of interest amongst the members in a project is valuable as a teams with a greater interest in their project are like more likely to excel and be successful
#### **Applicability of the team** ####
It is important to select a project that will enable all subteams are to work on their respective aspects of the project to fulfil medal criteria
#### **Usefulness** ####
The degree to which how useful the project is and how it can impact society (how stakeholders benefit and how many stakeholders are benefitted).

Following the team analysis, the project proposals were presented to advisors from UW’s Faculty of Biology. Advisors from the University of Waterloo Faculty of Biology: Brian Ingalls, Trevor Charles, Barbara Moffatt, Andrew Doxey, and Forbes Burkowski.

Description of Project
What problem are we solving?
How are we doing it?

Functional Prion Project
It is observed that fusing proteins together typically reduces function, although it is possible to engineer the prions such that the function increases.

Description of Project
What problem are we solving?
How are we doing it?

Oscillatory Fluorescence for Measurement

Fusing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to a protein of interest is a common way to detect the expression of that protein. The idea is that when you shine a certain frequency of light on your sample, if you see that it’s glowing green, you know that the GFP is being expressed and so the protein it’s fused to is also being expressed.

Problem: The problem is that if you want to measure how much a given protein is being expressed, you have to measure how much it is fluorescing, which is appreciably harder to do.

Solution: Fluorescence is hard to measure whereas time is easy to measure. If we can create a system where we see fluctuations in time rather than fluorescence, we can make a much easier technique for continuously collecting data on the level of expression of a protein over time.
Feasibility
Do we have the resources?
Do we have the experience?

86.6% feasibility 7/10 or higher

Consider both positive and negative impacts
Having to take samples and manually run tests for gene expression is a huge pain. Last year, one of the biggest problems we had was our limited data due to this restraint. When you don’t have enough data, it’s hard to confidently predict what is happening in your system. This project would make it significantly easier to collect large amounts of continuous data on gene expression which would be extremely useful for a huge number of synbio experiments.
Alternatives
Is there another more efficient/better way to go about solving the problem?

Measurement of LuxI - how does one know what the protein of interest is doing? (either fuse our protein of interest to LuxI or get the same promoter to control LuxI expression and the expression of protein of interest, but in the latter case we don’t know about protein degradation of our protein of interest, and the former is harder to do)

How to do this? Use mgFRN as a transcription factor to express a gene of interest. Cytotic gene only turned on during low oxygen levels.
As tumor shrinks, levels of O2 increase turning off our system.

Description of Project
What problem are we solving?
How are we doing it?

Zika
Our proposal aims to provide a novel method for controlling the prevalence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Aedes mosquito populations through the use of genetically engineered Pichia, a yeast endosymbiont of Aedes. This measure utilizes two components: the expression of AXL, a tyrosine-protein kinase receptor thought to be required for ZIKV internalization; and a CRISPR/FnCas9 system, equipped with a guide RNA (gRNA) to target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) encoding region of the ZIKV ssRNA genome. These constructs will be integrated into the Pichia genome, allowing the yeast to sequester ZIKV intracellularly and destroy the viral particles, effectively decreasing the risk of transmission from Aedes to humans. Since Pichia are naturally part of the Aedes gut microbiome, this process should not change the competitiveness of Aedes, resulting in minimal ecological consequences.


Feasibility
Do we have the resources?
Do we have the experience?

49.9% feasibility 7/10 or higher
No access to Zika or mosquitoes, our lab team would be performing very different experiments than what we actually want
Working with non-model organisms
The resources needed to develop this include different strains of yeast, dry pellets, CRISPR, zika like strands of RNA to implement as a proof of concept.
Most certainly not enough experiment to implement this far reaching proof of concept design not yet tested.

Personal opinions

83.4% interest 7/10 or more
73.4% applicable to subteam 7/10 or more

Novelty
Did we build on other ideas?

The idea of using a yeast species employed with CRISPR is an interesting and novel idea, albeit it is inspired by research papers. However, we would be really excited with the opportunity to work with these.

Protect people in Latin American countries from being infected with zika virus without harming the mosquito population and surrounding ecosystem.
Deployment is intuitive and fast to implement with closed off bodies of water and pellets of yeast thrown into.
Alternatives
