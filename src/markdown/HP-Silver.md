### **Project Determination** ###

The selection process for this years project began with several of our members creating project proposals and presenting their ideas to the whole team. Each project idea went through several layers of analysis, starting with over 30 individual assessments by members from all subteams. With the diverse disciplines amongst our team, we received input from a science, mathematics, engineering and business perspective. The individual assessments were compiled, resulting in a quantitative analysis of which project the team believed was the best to pursue. The assessments were based on the set of criteria that we have carefully articulated, which is described below:

### **Primary Criteria: evaluates the most important aspects of a project** ###
#### **Novelty** ####
This year, each of the project proposals fell under the Foundational Advance track. The basis of this track is to develop novel solutions to technical problems, thus the novelty of the project was one of the priorities.
#### **Feasibility** ####
When developing project ideas, teams must also consider the amount of resources available to them. It is important to be able to achieve their goals with what they have to produce a complete project

### **Secondary Criteria: evaluates the level of engagement for subteams in the organisation.** ###
#### **Interest** ####
The level of interest amongst the members in a project is valuable as a teams with a greater interest in their project are like more likely to excel and be successful
#### **Applicability of the team** ####
It is important to select a project that will enable all subteams are to work on their respective aspects of the project to fulfil medal criteria
#### **Usefulness** ####
The degree to which how useful the project is and how it can impact society (how stakeholders benefit and how many stakeholders are benefitted).

Following the team analysis, the project proposals were presented to advisors from UW’s Faculty of Biology. Advisors from the University of Waterloo Faculty of Biology: Brian Ingalls, Trevor Charles, Barbara Moffatt, Andrew Doxey, and Forbes Burkowski.

 Criteria | Oscillational Fluorescence for Measurement
--- | ---
<b> Description of Project </b> <br> <ul> <li> What kind of problem are we solving? </li> <li>How are we doing it? </li> </ul> | <ul> <li> Fusing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to a protein of interest is a common way to detect the expression of that protein </li> <li> The idea is that when you shine a certain frequency of light on your sample, if you see that it’s glowing green, you know that the GFP is being expressed and so the protein it’s fused to is also being expressed </li> <li> Problem: The problem is that if you want to measure how much a given protein is being expressed, you have to measure how much it is fluorescing, which is appreciably harder to do </li> <li> Solution: Fluorescence is hard to measure whereas time is easy to measure. </li> <li> If we can create a system where we see fluctuations in time rather than fluorescence, we can make a much easier technique for continuously collecting data on the level of expression of a protein over time </li> </ul>

<b> Alternative </b> <br> <ul> <li> Is there another more efficient/better way to go about solving the problem? </li> </ul> | <ul> <li> Measurement of LuxI - how does one know what the protein of interest is doing? (either fuse our protein of interest to LuxI or get the same promoter to control LuxI expression and the expression of protein of interest, but in the latter case we don’t know about protein degradation of our protein of interest, and the former is harder to do) </li> </ul>

Criteria | Zika
--- | ---
<b> Description of Project </b> <br> <ul> <li> What kind of problem are we solving? </li> <li>How are we doing it? </li> </ul> | <ul> <li> Our proposal aims to provide a novel method for controlling the prevalence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Aedes mosquito populations through the use of genetically engineered Pichia, a yeast endosymbiont of Aedes </li> <li> This measure utilizes two components: the expression of AXL, a tyrosine-protein kinase receptor thought to be required for ZIKV internalization; and a CRISPR/FnCas9 system, equipped with a guide RNA (gRNA) to target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) encoding region of the ZIKV ssRNA genome </li> <li> These constructs will be integrated into the Pichia genome, allowing the yeast to sequester ZIKV intracellularly and destroy the viral particles, effectively decreasing the risk of transmission from Aedes to humans </li> <li> Since Pichia are naturally part of the Aedes gut microbiome, this process should not change the competitiveness of Aedes, resulting in minimal ecological consequences </li> </ul>

<b>Interest/Applicability to Subteam </b> <br> <ul> <li> Personal opinions </li> </ul> | <ul> <li> 83.4% interest 7/10 or more </li> <li> 73.4% applicable to subteam 7/10 or more </li> </ul>
<b> Novelty </b> <br> <ul> <li> Did we build on other ideas? </li> </ul> | <ul> <li> The idea of using a yeast species employed with CRISPR is an interesting and novel idea, albeit it is inspired by research papers </li> <li> However, we would be really excited with the opportunity to work with these </li> </ul>
<b> Impact/Usefulness/Why are we doing it? </b> <br> <ul> <li> Economic </li> <li> Societal </li> <li> Environmental </li> <li> Ethical </li> <li> Material </li> <li> Emotional </li> </ul> <br> Consider both positive and negative impacts | <ul> <li> Protect people in Latin American countries from being infected with zika virus without harming the mosquito population and surrounding ecosystem </li> <li> Deployment is intuitive and fast to implement with closed off bodies of water and pellets of yeast thrown into </li> </ul>
<b> Alternative </b> <br> <ul> <li> Is there another more efficient/better way to go about solving the problem? </li> </ul> | <ul> <li> Wolbachia bacteria have been used similar studies, but have not implemented CRISPR, nor would this experiment work to use a human AXL receptor inside a prokaryote cell </li> </ul>
