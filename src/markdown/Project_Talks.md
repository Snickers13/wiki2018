### Talks

#### Biotech Bootcamp:

One of our policy team members, along with two of our advisors, attended the Biotech Bootcamp at University of Guelph this past May.

At this event, presentations and panel discussions focused on science policy and communication. There was many valuable discussions about the use of genetically modified (GM) technology, science advocacy, laws and regulations, biotechnology in the developing world, and environmental sustainability. As well, one of our advisors Dr. Trevor Charles spoke about iGEM highlighting the emphasis that the competition puts on human practices as a fundamental aspect of scientific work along with showing [Our Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnZx5P7sn9A&feature=youtu.be&a=) we made during our recruitment process. There also was a public event including the Canadian premier of documentary [Food Evolution](https://www.foodevolutionmovie.com/) which was followed by a public discussion on GMOs.

It was really an eye opening experience because the overwhelming message about the importance science communication and how important it is to tell the story of your work before someone else spins it in an undesirable or misconstrued way. This experience drove us to prioritize social media and outreach as one of our main human practices goals for our project.



#### CSM and Western Conferences:

This year, the University of Waterloo hosted the 67th annual Canadian Society of Microbiologists (CSM) Conference. Dr. Trevor Charles, one of our advisors, was mediating the synthetic biology section of the Conference and invited us to give a presentation during this session. In the presentation, we touched on iGEM, synthetic biology from an undergraduate perspective, our 2016 and 2017 iGEM projects, and the many benefits students receive through undergraduate research experiences.

Our talk was actually so well received that we got an invitation to also speak a the Synthetic Biology Symposium at the Western University later that summer. We were able to bring several members of our team, and we all had a great time hearing about academic and industrial research in synthetic biology, talking to experts in the field, and getting advice on some of the technical issues we were facing in our project. It was also exciting presenting our talk again, and being able to demonstrate the progress we had made since our previous talk at CSM.

A Gem in the Rough

Although we spend a lot of time showing others our final project, we also thought that it might be interesting to show what we do in and out of the lab on a daily basis during our build season: the elusive life of an iGEMer. One of our lab leads Max made a documentary of one 24 hour day during the summer interspersed with interviews from members of all our sub-teams.

Below are the presentation slides we used in our presentation at the CSM Talk.
