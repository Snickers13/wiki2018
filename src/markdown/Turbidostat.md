# Turbidostat

A turbidostat is a machine capable of maintaining the optical density, or turbidity, of a cell culture in liquid medium. Brian Ingalls, one of the principal investigators supervising the Waterloo iGEM team, commissioned Mark Soric, an associate of the lab, to make a turbidostat from scratch for use in the Ingalls lab.

Turbidostats are not widely available on the market, and at present there are few if any companies capable of tailor-making them for use in a lab. Mark Soric aimed to start a company with this goal, and was for a time stationed in the Velocity Garage incubator in Kitchener. At present, the first generation of his design is in the Ingalls lab, with the second generation design currently under construction.

The basic design has the following components:
A MatLab program run off of a personal computer (see image 1)
An Arduino Mega connected to the computer
A printed circuit board (PCB) connected to the Arduino
A series of motors connected to the PCB
A collection of peristaltic pumps connected to the Arduino (see image 2)
A vacuum connected to the Arduino
A vacuum manifold connected to the PCB
A 3D-printed sample vial holder, which the PCB is housed in and the vacuum manifold is connected to
