# Gender Equity in Synthetic Biology

![]({{image "labtrio.jpg" "directlink" mode}})

Waterloo iGEM and Waterloo WiSTEM (Women in STEM) teamed up to host a two-part event to address issues concerning gender equity in synthetic biology. Part one consisted of a panel discussion on how gender equity impacts synthetic biology and related fields. Part two was an accompanying laboratory component with two overarching goals: one, to provide a synthetic biology-centered environment in which individuals of all genders could feel welcome and two, to use a hands-on approach to familiarize students with synthetic biology.

**_Why talk about gender equity?_**  
Gender inequity has long been an issue in the STEM fields. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce (retrieved 2017), women make up less than 25% of individuals working in STEM fields. Million Women Mentors also notes that about 12% of women in undergraduate degrees study in STEM fields, but only about 3% of women in undergraduate degrees are still working in STEM fields 10 years after they graduate. Why is this the case? What can we do to resolve this glaring imbalance in STEM?  
When women and non-binary individuals are left out of the picture, everyone loses. We lose half of humanity’s brightest ideas, we lose diversity of thought and opinion, we lose valuable and relevant experience. So why is there still such an enormous disproportion between men and women in STEM?  
The Waterloo iGEM strongly believes these questions must be asked and discussed in order to start solving the overarching issue. To do this, we decided to team up with the University of Waterloo Women in STEM club (WiSTEM) to host a panel discussion on gender equality.

**_Why a Synthetic Biology Laboratory workshop?_**  
In addition to a discussion panel regarding gender equity, we included a hands-on synthetic biology aspect to this event. We wanted to set an example by opening a workshop for students, and by students to provide an open and comfortable environment for everyone to learn more about synthetic biology.  
During the [SHAD Valley](https://www.shad.ca/) workshop, students were seen to be actively engaged in conversation with supervising iGEM members during the process of experiments. We felt that this type of interaction encourages dialogue and is beneficial to both participants and the iGEM team; we thus kept the same format for our WiSTEM workshop.

###Gender Equity Panel Discussion with WiSTEM
**_A little bit about WiSTEM..._**  
Although they focus on the issue of gender imbalance, WiSTEM encourage both males and females, and anyone with a connection to STEM, to participate. Their activities are a mix of skills workshops, topical discussions, social events, speakers, and special trips. They connect young women and men in STEM by building a community to share ideas and learn new skills. They empower young minds with the skills to become forward-thinking and driven leaders. They advocate for women in STEM fields, educate, and raise awareness about the growing community.

**_So what did we do?_**

The event was intended to provide a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere to foster productive discussions on the subject of gender inequality in STEM fields. To help steer and fuel this discussion, we invited four STEM field panelists who are passionate about gender equality to answer a few thought-provoking questions. Members of the audience were encouraged to chime in at any time with their own thoughts, experiences, and questions. The moderator of the event had previous experience hosting gender equality and STEM field related panel discussions.

**_Who were our panelists?_**

**Colin Pierce** -  Lead of iGEM’s Policy and Practice team. Sweetest person you’ll ever meet; exemplary ally to women and non-binary individuals.  
**Dr. Elizabeth Meiering** - Chemistry professor and researcher at the University of Waterloo. She has expertise with protein folding, dynamics, function, engineering, and design
**Jawad Khan** -  University of Waterloo Biology student.  
**Krishna Patel** -  Member of WiSTEM.

**_What did we discuss?_**

* Could you give a little introduction of yourself? What are you studying/areas of research?
* Have you had any experiences concerning gender inequality in the STEM fields? If so, how has this affect you/your work?
* What do you wish your male counterparts knew about being a woman/non-binary person in STEM? For males on the panel, what advice do you have for other male advocates?
* What do you do to cope with/deal with gender inequality, do you have any tips for women in the field?
* What tips do you have for moving the field of synthetic biology and related biological fields forward?

**_Feedback_**

> “I found it beneficial to think about what I would do in a situation such as where I felt like my ideas were ignored in a male dominated work group. I feel that it is the responsibility of the individual with the problem to come forward as much as it is the employer’s responsibility to be aware of these issues and try to prevent them from occurring.” - Anonymous student

> “Before attending the panel I had not thought about the issue of equity in much detail so my views haven’t changed so much as I simply learned enough in the discussion to form an opinion.” - Anonymous student

### Synthetic Biology Workshop
The follow-up laboratory component of the workshop aimed to build upon the panel discussion and progress towards equality in synthetic biology by enabling members of all genders to build up their technical lab skillsconduct experiments in a laboratory environment.  
We hoped the two experiments helped facilitate interest and engage participants in some of the fundamental aspects of synthetic biology. Students were assisted by iGEM members to conduct cell transformation and streak plating experiments.

**_Introduction and Lab Safety_**

Reiterating the panel discussion, the lab opened with an overview of the underlying gender equity issues in STEM fields before moving on to a discussion of the sciences and potentials of synthetic biology.
As well, a section of the presentation was devoted to lab safety to emphasize the importance of following laboratory safety procedures. All University of Waterloo students are required to take WHIMIS

**_Part 1: Transformation Protocol_**

Cell transformation is ubiquitous in areas of biotechnology, genetic engineering, and molecular biology. Particularly in synthetic biology, transformation of synthesized DNA sequences that have been ligated into cloning vectors into bacterial organisms is essential to study the synthetic gene or system. We felt that the difficulty and relevance of the technique made it a good entry point to garner interests and spur curiosity in the area of synthetic biology. Not to mention that it is also a key technique employed in our team's (and many other iGEM teams’) experiments.

Members were informed on the necessary background information regarding transformation including plasmids design, cell competency, and standard transformation protocol. Members then performed their own transformation experiments using in the common cloning _E.coli_ strain DH5-alpha.

**_Part 2: Streak Plating_**

Drawing on the success of the [SHAD valley](www.shad.ca) workshop, the team felt it was important to also include a streak plating experiment in the synthetic biology workshop. Members were instructed to streak plate their own design and were encouraged to check back on their results afterwards at the iGEM office. The chromoprotein-modified (Bba-K592012 biobrick) _E.coli_ adds a more visual element to further engage participants.

**_Feedback_**

> “I enjoyed the lab portion of this workshop immensely, the experiments were a blast and I particularly enjoyed being able to talk to the upper years running the workshop.” - Anonymous student

> “As a first year I am glad I was able to learn so much, not only preparing for my biology labs before they started, but also getting real advice on what to expect over the next few years of university.” - Anonymous student

> “I loved the experiment that the iGEM team chose to run, I had never imagined I would be editing a bacterial genome within the first few weeks of starting university. I had always wanted to do it and it was surprisingly not too complicated.” - Anonymous student
